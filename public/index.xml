      <title>Swatch: a color palette manager</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Between one thing and the other, I found myself in need for a palette manager: something to let me categorize different palettes and easily pick and name colors depending on their use.</p>
<p>I had a look at some already available options, but nothing seemed to fit the bill, so (as it&rsquo;s often the case) I decided to make my own.</p>
<hr>
<p>I want to make a quick tangent on how easy it has become for me to quickly <del>hack together</del> build a GTK app.</p>
<p>A big part of the reason is reusing existing code and tooling from my other projects, as well as learning the proper way to do things.</p>
<p>Another big reason is the great ecosystem that&rsquo;s been growing around GNOME technologies recently, particularly after the release of GTK4.</p>
<p>First of all, libadwaita is a huge help for building any kind of application. It ships a bunch of widgets and other useful tidbits such as pre-built style classes, implementing the rules defined in the GNOME HIG. This allows for quick building, clean code and great looks out of the box.</p>
<p>But libadwaita has already been praised enough by me and other developers, so that&rsquo;s not really anything new.</p>
<p>The other incredibly useful tool that I&rsquo;m using for my apps is <a href="https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/">Blueprint</a> by <a href="https://www.jwestman.net/">James Westman</a>. Without going into too much detail, it&rsquo;s a markup language for building GTK4 UIs in a clean and simple way. You then use the blueprint compiler to compile it to regular XML without ever having to look at it yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Going back to Swatch, it&rsquo;s really as simple as it gets: you can create as many palettes as you want, and you can add colors to each palette. You can give custom names to everything, and you can quickly copy the color in hexadecimal (or <code>rgb()</code>) format. I also decided to give Swatch two view modes: list and grid, similar to what you&rsquo;d see in a file manager.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Swatch_a_color_palette_manager/scrot1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And with that said, this little tool does exactly what I need. Hopefully you can find it useful as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/gabmus/swatch">The code is available on GNOME GitLab</a> as usual, and you can try it for yourself using the latest flatpak CI build.</p>
<p>As for a proper release, I&rsquo;m planning to tag one and submit it to Flathub as soon as the GNOME 42 runtime comes out, so stay tuned for that!</p>

      <title>Block ads in WebKitGtk</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/block_ads_in_webkitgtk/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/block_ads_in_webkitgtk/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most requested features (and for a good reason) in Feeds has always been ad blocking.</p>
<p>I never came around to implement it, mostly because I couldn&rsquo;t find a guide or any similar resource, except for <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Epiphany">GNOME Web&rsquo;s source code</a>, and that&rsquo;s not exactly easy to navigate. At least, it isn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>Today I decided to come back to it, and I found that it&rsquo;s actually a rather easy task! That&rsquo;s why I wanted to document this process, in hope that someone might find it useful one day.</p>
<p>First off, you&rsquo;ll need one or more <strong>blocklists</strong>, in JSON format. I used <a href="https://easylist.to/">EasyList</a>, in particular <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist_min_content_blocker.json">here&rsquo;s the link to the JSON block list</a>. Blocklists should be updated frequently, so it&rsquo;s advisable to have some sort of mechanism to download and update them at runtime automatically.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now jump to the code, which will be Python in this case, but hopefully can be easily adapted to other languages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use some closures for convenience.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python3" data-lang="python3"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#6272a4"># have a function that downloads text</span>

<p>This said, if you want to look at the actual code that I&rsquo;m using in Feeds, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gfeeds/-/blob/0a3d3da66d7d4ede155db24fb0f83f03b47f5489/gfeeds/webview.py#L78">you can find it here</a> (this is a snapshot to today&rsquo;s current latest commit, in the future you may want to look at newer code). It contains some logic to automatically refresh or even remove the blocklist.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think in the comments, and feel free to point out any errors, or if something is unclear.</p>

      <title>Gtk4, LibAdwaita and the new Feeds</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/gtk4_libadwaita_and_the_new_feeds/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 11:52:10 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/gtk4_libadwaita_and_the_new_feeds/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>So, something big is coming for my news reader app <a href="https://gfeeds.gabmus.org">Feeds</a>.</p>
<p>Most of this year, as far as personal projects go, I spent at close contact with Gtk4, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/gnome/libadwaita">libadwaita</a> and the awesome people over at the various matrix chat rooms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent this time porting <a href="https://whatip.gabmus.org">What IP</a>, <a href="https://hydrapaper.gabmus.org">HydraPaper</a> and <a href="https://giara.gabmus.org">Giara</a> to Gtk4+libadwaita.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Gtk4_LibAdwaita_and_the_new_Feeds/whatip_hydrapaper_giara.avif" alt="What IP, HydraPaper and Giara at their latest iteration, side by side"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy of the results, and I&rsquo;m even happier with how this new stack is shaping up.</p>
<p>The porting process for the most part has been relatively painless across the board, with only minor changes (albeit, many of them) needed for the actual porting. Along with the updated stack, I&rsquo;ve been able to introduce new features and improvements, for the most part thanks to the new widgets available in libadwaita making my life a lot easier.</p>
<p>What IP being the simpler of the bunch didn&rsquo;t really change much from its original iteration, except for some code cleanups. But hey, the theme is different and it looks amazing!</p>
<p>HydraPaper also stayed pretty much the same, with the exception of a new wallpaper folder selector (that you can see in the image above) in the form of a brand new widget, the mighty Flap! It&rsquo;s a sidebar that can open above other widgets, mostly a glorified overlay, but with extra bells and whistles. On a regular monitor you can open it with the usual button on the headerbar, the same that opened a Popover before, but on a touchscreen you can swipe to open it! Plus, compared to the previous Popover implementation, the new Flap is part of the main window, meaning it can scale to fill the entire vertical space of the window, making this selector/filter much easier to interact with thanks to the increased size.</p>
<p>Giara being one of the more complex apps, received a lot more work and attention. First off, the post views have been re-implemented using ListView, a brand new (still somewhat janky) widget in Gtk4 that allows for better optimized lists, where rows get recycled instead of adding up, with performance quickly grinding to a halt. This change required a lot of work, since my usual terrible implementation of ListBox is 100% incompatible with the way ListView works. But with a lot of help and elbow grease, I managed to land it, making the whole experience of mindlessly scrolling through reddit a little less frustrating (hopefully). Also, thanks to another awesome widget, AdwCarousel, I was able to add support for image galleries. And they support touch gestures, too! Along with these changes, I also added an internal fullscreen image viewer, very much inspired by the one in telegram-desktop.</p>
<hr>
<p>But let&rsquo;s jump to the actual reason why I&rsquo;m writing this post, <em>The new Feeds</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Gtk4_LibAdwaita_and_the_new_Feeds/feeds.avif" alt="What the new Feeds will look like"></p>
<p>You see, I wanted to start porting Feeds to Gtk4 sooner than it ended up happening. Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to up until recently. The reason being WebKit. WebKit support for Gtk4 has been broken for a while, and just recently (not all that recently, tho) it got to a point where it was usable enough for me to start the port. At the time of writing this, you still need to enable Gtk4 support in WebKit by using custom build flags, making development possible by building WebKit myself (which, by the way, takes <em>a lot</em> of time), but at the same time making distribution unfeasible. Flatpak being the main way I distribute my apps, it could work in theory, but having a 1GB+ bundle for a simple news reader isn&rsquo;t really a great user experience, so for now I&rsquo;m holding off this release, waiting for it to become available in the GNOME runtime.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s move on to what&rsquo;s actually new in Feeds.</p>
<p>First of all, from a user facing perspective, The whole look of the app is quite different. Apart from the new Adwaita theme in libadwaita, the article list uses the new <code>navigation-sidebar</code> style class, with cool rounded corners for the rows and no separators between them, but still providing enough visual separation. Label sizes in the rows have also been tweaked slightly.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, I added article pictures! The code is based on the custom picture widget I made for Giara, and let me tell you: they make any article that more interesting!</p>
<p>As for visual changes, another big one is the new filter view, again based on the Flap widget.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Gtk4_LibAdwaita_and_the_new_Feeds/feeds_filters.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story to HydraPaper, the old Popover implementation was hard to use and unintuitive. A sidebar is a much more common pattern, plus the added vertical size makes it easier to find the feed you wanna look at.</p>
<p>As for the articles list, you may think ListView would be perfect here as well, and that&rsquo;s what I thought as well. Unfortunately due to some technical issues with how ListView row selection and activation work at this current time, while it does work, it&rsquo;s not really all that convenient. I added the ListView to Feeds, and you can enable it in the preferences, in the advanced section, but I kept the ListBox around as a default, and I also changed its API so that it&rsquo;s the same as the ListView implementation. You can switch between one or the other and try them out for yourself, hopefully at some point I can get rid of the ListBox and have the ListView be the default.</p>
<p>With all the nice changes and cool things this port brought with it, I decided to tackle one of the most annoying issues I&rsquo;ve had with Feeds: the actual feed parsing.</p>
<p>Up until recently I&rsquo;ve been using the very popular <a href="https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/">feedparser</a> python library, but I&rsquo;ve always been dissatisfied with both its performance and its weird quirks. I came to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s not the kind of library I was looking for.</p>
<p>I tried searching for alternatives, and I broadened my search to any language, but unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t find something I really liked.</p>
<p>So I decided to write my own! And for the best performance I wrote it in&hellip; C++! Maybe some of you were expecting Rust? Maybe one day, but I don&rsquo;t really know Rust right now 😕</p>
<p>This new library is called <a href="https://gitlab.com/gabmus/syndication-domination">Sydndication Domination</a> or syndom for short (it&rsquo;s a bit cheesy, I know). Syndom is tailor made for Feeds, but of course it can be used for any application.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based around an awesome XML parser for C++ called <a href="https://pugixml.org/">pugixml</a>, if you ever need to parse XML I suggest you take a look at it. Syndom is able to parse an RSS or Atom file and extract all the useful information a news reader would need, and most importantly, <em>it</em> does the heavy lifting of trying all the different places a certain information can be found in. It can also parse Opml files for importing feeds, as well as Html files for extracting other useful information from, say a blog post, like the featured image, the feed URL, the title or the description.</p>
<p>The whole thing comes together inside Feeds with python bindings, created using another library called <a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/">pybind11</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly this has probably been the biggest change to ever come to Feeds. The performance difference is enormous, it&rsquo;s like night and day, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all I wanted you to know, hopefully I can release Feeds sooner rather than later as I really, <em>really</em> want people to use this new version rather than the crusty old one.</p>
<p>If you want to try it for yourself <a href="https://cloud.disroot.org/s/2Dj94NxWn6HRAZC">you can download a recent snapshot I made manually from this link</a>. Please do let me know what you think in the comments or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#org.gabmus:matrix.org">in the matrix room</a> if you prefer. And feel free to report any bugs you encounter along the way!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Commento for a while for comments (without much adoption to be honest), and while I really love the project, and the simplicity of its approach, there&rsquo;s always been one unavoidable thing I never really liked too much: if you want to comment, you have to register to my commento instance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s less than ideal, considering that if I did have lots of people who wanted to comment, that&rsquo;d have been quite a strain on my humble home server, where my commento instance is hosted.</p>
<p>Today I found <a href="https://karmanyaah.malhotra.cc/tech/2021/06/website-things/">this post</a> on Mastodon (feel free to <a href="https://linuxrocks.online/@gabmus">follow me there</a> by the way) by Karmanyaah Malhotra about how he reworked his website recently. I always enjoy reading about other people&rsquo;s websites, so I quickly read through it, just to find out about this comment system called <a href="https://cactus.chat">Cactus Comments</a>.</p>
<p>Cactus Comments uses <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> to create a federated comment section on your website. If you have a Matrix account on any instance, you can comment on Cactus! Heck you can even use a full-fledged Matrix client to do so! That&rsquo;s just great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free to use and self hostable as well, so there&rsquo;s really not much of an excuse not to try it out. Plus if you already have a Matrix account you&rsquo;re already halfway there.</p>
<p>I integrated it in my <a href="https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia">Ficurinia Hugo theme</a> without much effort, so there&rsquo;s another bonus point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m really happy about this new comment system, it&rsquo;s one less service running on my home server and due to its decentralized and federated nature it will hopefully encourage more people to leave interesting comments and get a conversation going!</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi Pico pinout in your terminal</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/raspberry_pi_pico_pinout_in_your_terminal/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/raspberry_pi_pico_pinout_in_your_terminal/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico">Raspberry Pi Pico</a>, and I quickly realized that I&rsquo;d really love to have a quick pinout reference in my terminal.</p>
<p>I thought of making a man page, but I would have lost the color (I don&rsquo;t know how to use arbitrary colors in groff), so I just created a simple text file with ascii escape sequences for colors and called it a day. It works, and it&rsquo;s pretty!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m uploading it here for your convenience (and mine as well), you should be able to grab it from your *NIX box by just typing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>curl https://gabmus.org/pico_pinout
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you want to save it in a file, just add <code>&gt; some_file_name</code> to the above.</p>

      <title>Making a D-Bus Daemon with Python and Flatpak</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/making-a-dbus-daemon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 09:42:43 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/making-a-dbus-daemon/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>I learned most of this stuff from <a href="https://larry-price.com/blog/categories/dbus/">this awesome series of articles by Larry Price</a>. Give it a read, it&rsquo;s worth it.</em></p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>D-Bus daemons are quite useful tools. What would you need them for? Well, I decided to add one to <a href="https://hydrapaper.gabmus.org">HydraPaper</a> to do two jobs:</p>
<ol>
<li>change the wallpaper periodically</li>
<li>listen for monitor configuration changes and adapt to it, so that when you plug or unplug a monitor, the wallpaper doesn&rsquo;t get all messed up</li>
</ol>
<p>There could be other reasons, like provide an always active &ldquo;server&rdquo; component to your application, or if you need to send notifications to the user even when your main app isn&rsquo;t running.</p>
<p>Of course possibilities are limitless, it&rsquo;s just another way to create software. <strong>Using D-Bus to create this daemon allows your graphical application to communicate with the main application in an easy and predictable way</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about D-Bus, I suggest you give a look at <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">this nicely written article by Patrick Louis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>Now what languages are we gonna use? Ha! Trick question! If you know me (or can read the title) you know we&rsquo;ll be using Python. Besides I&rsquo;m pretty sure you can use whatever language you prefer, but today that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna use.</p>
<p>Before we begin, it&rsquo;s good practice to choose a unique id for our daemon using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation">reverse domain name notation</a>. For the HydraPaper Daemon I chose <code>org.gabmus.hydrapaper.Daemon</code>. It&rsquo;s important that your name is unique, so it&rsquo;s a good practice to name it something like <code>ext.yourPersonalHandle.yourApplicationName.Daemon</code>. Another good idea is if you have a registered domain like I do for <code>gabmus.org</code>, to just use that, followed by the name of your app and some other indication that this service will be a daemon. <a href="https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names">You can read more about valid names here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have decided this id, just put it in a constant, along with the same but separated by slashes as if it was a path, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>UID         <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span>  <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;org.gabmus.myapp.Daemon&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>UID_AS_PATH <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;/org/gabmus/myapp/Daemon&#39;</span>  <span style="color:#6272a4"># notice the leading slash</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s now start with the basics: we need a class extending <code>dbus.service.Object</code>. This will be our <strong>D-Bus Object</strong>, and some of the methods inside of it will be exposed as <strong>D-Bus methods</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">import</span> dbus
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">import</span> dbus.service  <span style="color:#6272a4"># yes, you need to import this as well</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>UID         <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span>  <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;org.gabmus.hydrapaper.Daemon&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>UID_AS_PATH <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;/org/gabmus/hydrapaper/Daemon&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">class</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">MyappDaemon</span>(dbus<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>service<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>Object):

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            bus_name, UID_AS_PATH
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now before moving on, I decided to include the final part here: bootstrapping our main loop and all of the things we need to get this bad boy running, so that you can actually try things out and see what&rsquo;s going on instead of just blindly copy-pasting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need these additional imports:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">from</span> dbus.mainloop.glib <span style="color:#ff79c6">import</span> DBusGMainLoop

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Alright, let&rsquo;s resume from where we left.</p>
<p>We have a D-Bus object, and the thing can run doing nothing now, awesome.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give this object a method we can invoke from outside.</p>
<p>To do this we&rsquo;ll create a method in our class and decorate it with <code>@dbus.service.method</code>. This decorator takes some parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dbus_interface</code>: the interface we want this method to be attached to (interfaces are another nesting level for D-Bus, honestly I think they&rsquo;re overkill for this kind of use, so we&rsquo;re just going to use our previously declared <code>UID</code> as the interface, it&rsquo;s gonna work).</li>
<li><code>in_signature</code>: what kind of parameters our method requires</li>
<li><code>out_signature</code>: what kind of output our method returns</li>
</ul>
<p>For the signatures, you can read more about data types you can use <a href="https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/tutorial.html#data-types">in this documentation page</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a simple <code>hello</code> method that takes a string and returns another string.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">class</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">MyappDaemon</span>(dbus<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>service<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>Object):

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it! Easy, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Now if like me you want to have some action to run every x seconds or something, you can just use the standard threads and sleep model of Python, not much else you need as far as D-Bus goes.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see what we need to do to package this new Daemon in a Flatpak and have it being recognized by the system as proper and activatable D-Bus service.</p>
<h2 id="plumbing">Plumbing</h2>
<p>First off, we&rsquo;ll be using meson, so I assume you already are using it for your base application.</p>
<p>Assuming we have our daemon inside a sub-folder called <code>myapp_daemon</code>. For packages reasons I suggest you call the actual daemon Python file something like <code>myappd.in.py</code>. Notice the trailing <code>d</code>, it means daemon. Another thing: <strong>make sure to give this file executable permissions!</strong> (<code>chmod +x myapp_daemon/myappd.in.py</code>)</p>
<p>At the beginning of <code>myappd.in.py</code> we&rsquo;re going to insert our shebang like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#6272a4">#!@PYTHON@</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In our main <code>meson.build</code> file, the one in the root of the project, let&rsquo;s put the following somewhere you feel is appropriate (skip anything that is already there of course):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-meson" data-lang="meson"><span style="display:flex;"><span>prefix <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> <span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">get_option</span>(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;prefix&#39;</span>)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, let&rsquo;s create <code>myapp_daemon/meson.build</code>, and put this inside:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it for the daemon itself, but we still need some other files to let Flatpak (or your host operating system for that matter if you install this with a regular package manager) recognize this as an activatable service.</p>
<p><em>Note: an activatable service means a service that will be started automagically as soon as an application tries to connect to it.</em></p>
<p>For this, I like to work inside of a new folder called <code>data</code> inside the project root.</p>

      <title>Giara is a reddit app for Linux</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 09:55:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_linux/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a quite avid reddit user. Like it or not, reddit is a very central place where communities for stuff that I care about tend to aggregate.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I have felt the need for a reddit app on my Linux desktop, and I waited and kept waiting for one that would finally allow me to break free of using the web version.</p>
<p>Some honorable mentions are due to projects like the now seemingly abandoned <a href="https://github.com/samdroid-apps/something-for-reddit">Something for reddit</a> and the terminal app <a href="https://gitlab.com/ajak/tuir/">Tuir</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they were not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>At some point I just decided to start scratching this itch of mine, and so my quest began.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_Linux/screenshot.avif" alt="Screenshot of Giara"></p>
<p>And this is how Giara got to be!</p>
<p>At this current stage Giara is already usable, with most of the main features you&rsquo;d expect from a reddit app to work.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_Linux/screenshot2.avif" alt="Screenshot of a comment tree"></p>
<p>Many people, including some familiar faces, stepped up and helped me in the development process, and I have already received some contributions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% done, tho. It still needs to reach feature parity with the reddit web client, as features like awards, polls, galleries and private messages are still to be implemented. I&rsquo;m also working on improving performance, as the app tends to be slower than I would prefer sometimes. All of these missing features and improvements are up next in my to-do list.</p>
<p>The app has also been recently moved to the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World">World group in GNOME&rsquo;s GitLab</a>, and I&rsquo;m incredibly happy for it! The next step now is to add support for the <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/"><em>Damned Lies</em></a> translation platform, so that it can be even easier to contribute new translations to the project.</p>
<p>As always any help and contribution is highly appreciated!</p>
<p>You can find the repo on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/giara">GNOME&rsquo;s GitLab</a> and you can download the latest stable version of Giara from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.giara">Flathub</a>. You may also want to take a look at <a href="https://giara.gabmus.org">Giara&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

      <title>Map Mouse Back and Forward Buttons in Your GTK App</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/map_mouse_back_and_forward_buttons_in_your_gtk_app/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 11:39:57 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/map_mouse_back_and_forward_buttons_in_your_gtk_app/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The back and forward buttons on your mouse are incredibly useful, at least for me. I use them all the time!</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find a proper way to map it on my app until I asked on the GTK Matrix chatroom, there <a href="https://github.com/baedert">baedert</a> sent me a couple of links to how he did it in his app corebird.</p>
<p>I translated the code to Python and decided to make a blog post to archive the procedure.</p>
<p>First, here&rsquo;s a function that creates the &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; and assigns it to a widget and a callback function</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">def</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">add_mouse_button_accel</span>(widget, function):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    gesture <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> Gtk<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>GestureMultiPress<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>new(widget)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    gesture<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>set_button(<span style="color:#bd93f9">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    gesture<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>set_propagation_phase(Gtk<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>PropagationPhase<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>CAPTURE)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    gesture<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>connect(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;pressed&#39;</span>, function)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#ff79c6">return</span> gesture
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you may have noticed, this function returns the created gesture. You may think there is no need for it and ideally you&rsquo;d be right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a small issue: due to something that I could only identify as a bug in GTK, you need to keep the <code>Gtk.GestureMultiPress</code> object around, otherwise it gets destroyed and the button clicks are no longer registered.</p>
<p>Once the gesture is returned, you can assign it to something that stays in memory (or you can modify this function and do something like <code>widget.mouse_accel_gesture = gesture</code> and be done with it).</p>
<p>As for the function associated with the mouse click, here&rsquo;s a template you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">def</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">on_mouse_event</span>(gesture, n_press, x, y):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    btn <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> gesture<span style="color:#ff79c6">.</span>get_current_button()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#ff79c6">if</span> btn <span style="color:#ff79c6">==</span> <span style="color:#bd93f9">8</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#6272a4"># Handle the Back button here</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#ff79c6">elif</span> btn <span style="color:#ff79c6">==</span> <span style="color:#bd93f9">9</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#6272a4"># Handle the Forward button here</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There you go, hope it helps. If you have any trouble feel free to leave a comment or contact me (contact info can be found <a href="/pages/about">in the about page</a>)</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code is actually simpler than I imagined, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing all of this in a self contained class I unoriginally called <em>PictureView</em>, of course you can rename it to your liking. It takes a path to a picture as an argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m subclassing <code>Gtk.DrawingArea</code> to be able to draw arbitrary stuff with cairo.</p>
<p>The first thing is creating a base <code>GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf</code> to store the original image, create a cairo surface from that image and then tell the widget what to do inside the <code>do_draw</code> method.</p>
<p>This will in turn find out the size at which it wants to be rendered.</p>
<p>For the width, I want all of it, or in other words all of the allocated width that the widget has.</p>
<p>As for the height, I simply calculate the target height (indicated as <code>allocated_height</code> in the formula below) by solving a simple proportion between the picture width and the allocated width:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pixbuf_width / allocated_width = pixbuf_height / allocated_height
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once I have this useful data, I set the widget size request with the new values I found (I leave the width as -1 so that it doesn&rsquo;t change).</p>
<p>Then, I scale the whole cairo context with the <code>scale</code> method, calculating the scale factor as <code>widget_width / pixbuf_width</code>, and finally set the cairo context source to the image surface I created in the constructor.</p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget to call <code>cairo.paint()</code> as well.</p>
<p>All in all this is pretty straight forward, but you need to know what you&rsquo;re doing, and I certainly did not up to about a couple of hour ago.</p>
<p>Hopefully if you need to do this, you will find this blog post and avoid wasting two hours of your time trying to figure this out from sparse C code floating around the internet.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a final note, I&rsquo;m being told that in GTK4 GtkPicture is able to do this, but since I&rsquo;m still stuck with GTK3 (as you probably are as well if you&rsquo;re reading this), this is the best solution I could find.</p>

      <title>Man pages with Markdown and Pandoc</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/man_pages_with_markdown_and_pandoc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:49:06 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/man_pages_with_markdown_and_pandoc/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Man pages are awesome. They genuinely are. In any *nix system you can just get documentation on your programs or even some programming things (namely a lot of C stuff, this was very useful in University) <strong>offline</strong> by just using a tiny simple command.</p>
<p>Of course writing man pages is a different thing. They are written in <em>groff</em>. I am not a fan of it, although I know people who do enjoy using it.</p>
<h3 id="markdown--pandoc">Markdown ❤ Pandoc</h3>
<p>Of course the obvious thing to do is write your docs in <strong>Markdown</strong>, since it&rsquo;s the best simple markup language out there. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s very easy to convert Markdown to groff, and consequently into a man page.</p>
<p>And of course you can just use <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to do that. It&rsquo;s as simple and straight forward as you can imagine, it&rsquo;s just one command away:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pandoc --standalone --to man mymanpage.1.md -o mymanpage.1
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s actually not the first time I&rsquo;ve done something like this. The first was with <a href="https://gitlab.com/gabmus/glorious-man-pages">the handy manuals I wrote for the Glorious GMMK keyboard and Model O mouse</a>. Most of the fancy things you&rsquo;d wanna tweak with these peripherals are done with weird key combinations, and having the paper manuals or even worse PDF copies of those around isn&rsquo;t very practical. So of course I wrote man pages for those.</p>
<p>If you know Markdown, the syntax you have to use is of course very simple, but if you wanna do it right, you may want to know about a couple of dialect forms of Markdown:</p>
<h3 id="definition-lists">Definition lists</h3>
<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists">Definition lists</a> are perfect for describing particular commands or arguments in your man page, and they get rendered just as you think they would in a man page. They are not part of the original Markdown spec, but Pandoc supports them no problem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really easy to use, here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`-h, --help`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:   Shows the help message
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The backticks are optional but they help escaping weird characters and besides they mark a section that is effectively code.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-blocks">Metadata blocks</h3>
<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks">Metadata blocks</a> are also useful to show the title of the man page. Definitely one of those small touches that you might want to have in your man page, as every proper one has them.</p>
<p>Again, the syntax is fairly straight forward. You want to have this at the beginning of your file and looking something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>% mymanual(1) Version 0.9.99 | Example manual for this blog post
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Finally I want to include an example Markdown man page I recently made for <a href="https://hydrapaper.gabmus.org">HydraPaper</a>, so that you can get a better grasp of what a full file could look like. Of course you can also find this file in HydraPaper&rsquo;s repository if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>% HydraPaper(1) | General Commands Manual

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>====
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>HydraPaper - Wallpaper manager with multi monitor support
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>SYNOPSIS
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>========
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`hydrapaper [-h] [-c WALLPAPER_PATH [WALLPAPER_PATH ...]] [-m WALLPAPER_MODES [WALLPAPER_MODES ...]] [-r] [-l]`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>DESCRIPTION
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>===========
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>HydraPaper is a wallpaper manager, specifically designed to work around the lack of functionality of many desktop environments to set a different wallpaper for each monitor in a multi monitor setup. It accomplishes this by scaling and merging different wallpapers into a single one and setting it as spanned.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It currently supports various desktop environments, including GNOME, MATE, Cinnamon and Budgie. Experimental support is included for the sway window manager.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>OPTIONS
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>=======
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`-h, --help`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:   Show the help message and exit
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`-c, --cli WALLPAPER_PATHS...`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:   Set wallpapers from the command line
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`-m, --modes WALLPAPER_MODES...`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:   Specify the modes for the wallpapers (`zoom`, <span style="color:#f1fa8c">`center_black`</span>, <span style="color:#f1fa8c">`center_blur`</span>, <span style="color:#f1fa8c">`fit_black`</span>, <span style="color:#f1fa8c">`fit_blur`</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`-r, --random`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:   Set wallpapers randomly
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f1fa8c">`-l, --lockscreen`</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:   Set lockscreen wallpapers instead of desktop ones (for supported desktop environments)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>BUGS
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>====
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Bugs can be reported and filed at https://gitlab.gnome.org/gabmus/hydrapaper/issues
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>If you are not using the flatpak version of HydraPaper, or if you are using an otherwise out of date or downstream version of it, please make sure that the bug you want to report hasn&#39;t been already fixed or otherwise caused by a downstream patch.

      <title>Back to Hugo and on static site generators and custom themes</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/back-to-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 09:19:02 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/back-to-hugo/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>As you can see, this website is kinda different. I remade it, just because why not.</p>
<p>I was previously using Hexo with a nice theme called cactus (properly altered to match my preference), but at some point I got tired of that as well.</p>
<p>I wanted to create something simple and straight forward. This is the kind of website without too many bells and whistles. Just a blog, period.</p>
<p>The initial idea of static site generators kinda goes well with this concept, but I don&rsquo;t exactly know when or how things changed. Maybe people liked these tools so much they tried to make them more general purpose, or they just wanted to use them for different things. Doesn&rsquo;t matter, point is that these generators, once simple and easy ways to make a decent blog without the burden and subsequent psychological trauma of a LAMP stack, are now bloated and messy.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair it&rsquo;s not really an issue with the generators themselves, but with the themes. It&rsquo;s the theme that has the responsibility for how the content is meant to be laid out, what is allowed and how you should do things. Honestly calling them themes is an understatement. If the generator is the skeleton, the <em>theme</em> is muscles, flesh and nervous system. The so called generator is useless without one.</p>
<p>Making themes is one of those things that I don&rsquo;t like to do. I didn&rsquo;t like it when I was a kid playing around with Wordpress and Joomla, and I don&rsquo;t like it now. I&rsquo;d rather make a plain website instead. But that&rsquo;s not feasible for a blog because of pagination, tags, RSS feed and whatever else that doesn&rsquo;t come to mind right now.</p>
<p>But at some point I just said, well F it, let&rsquo;s do it. It&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;ll do once and basically forget it, and the gain I get from it is a website I actually like and that I can easily customize and change around whenever I feel like it.</p>
<p>I decided to use Hugo since it seems to be the most popular static site generator at this point in time. I&rsquo;m not new to it, and I somewhat knew my way around it (or so I thought) since I already modified another theme for <a href="https://techpills.technology">the latest iteration of the Tech Pills website</a>. After watching some YouTube tutorials and digging through <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">the lackluster documentation</a> what came out was a new theme I decided to call <a href="https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia">Ficurinia</a>.</p>
<p>The name choice was pretty easy. This theme is inspired by the theme I was using before with Hexo called cactus. This being sort of a grittier version of cactus (if not a more personal vision on the same idea) I decided to call it after the Sicilian word for Indian fig aka prickly pear, <em>Ficurinia</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to have made this theme. It&rsquo;s simple, no weird layouts or messy animations, no javascript, and it works on mobile without any modification or special rules. Heck it even looks pretty damn good in the links command line browser.</p>
<p>So this is my new home now. Hope you like it.</p>

      <title>Python unittest &#43; Meson</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/python-unittest-meson/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 11:27:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/python-unittest-meson/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Alright, I started writing some unit tests for <a href="https://gabmus.gitlab.io/gnome-feeds">Feeds</a> and I wanted to integrate them into meson, so that I can just run <code>meson test</code> or <code>ninja test</code> during build and have them run automagically.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, they <em>should</em> also run when creating a flatpak package, so that I don&rsquo;t accidentally push a broken built to users.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the very simplistic way I accomplished this task:</p>
<ul>
<li>have your tests in a <code>tests</code> directory in the root of your project</li>
<li>add this to your <code>meson.build</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-meson" data-lang="meson"><span style="display:flex;"><span>envdata <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> <span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">environment</span>()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>python_paths <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> [<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">join_paths</span>(meson.current_build_dir(), <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;..&#39;</span>)]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>envdata.append(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;PYTHONPATH&#39;</span>, python_paths)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>envdata.append(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;TESTS_BUILDDIR&#39;</span>, meson.current_build_dir())
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">test</span>(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;unit-tests&#39;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  import(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;python&#39;</span>).find_installation(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;python3&#39;</span>),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  args: [<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;-m&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;unittest&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#39;tests&#39;</span>],
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  env: envdata
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>While this works locally, I&rsquo;m still having problems with running them during the flatpak build in GitLab CI, so I&rsquo;ll try to solve that as well and update this post accordingly.</p>

      <title>Feeds moved to World and design overhaul</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-moved-to-world-and-design-overhaul/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 12:03:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-moved-to-world-and-design-overhaul/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It finally happened, Feeds is now part of the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World">World</a> group! <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gfeeds">Here&rsquo;s the new repository</a>! But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll keep up with the existing GitLab mirror.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t change too much in terms of development, but it surely makes the app more discoverable. It also provides <a href="https://world.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gfeeds/">this very nice new URL for Feeds&rsquo; website</a> which is under gnome&rsquo;s domain name (that&rsquo;s pretty cool, uh?).</p>
<p>As for Feeds&rsquo; development, lately I&rsquo;ve begun a process of small cleanups here and there, and most importantly design changes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Feeds-moved-to-World-and-design-overhaul/feeds-next-window.avif" alt="Feeds&amp;rsquo; new UI"></p>
<p>Thanks to the help of <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/bertob">Tobias Bernard</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/exalm">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> and some other awesome people from the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!nrNOrVsRZxzaDdspgs:talk.puri.sm?via=talk.puri.sm&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=librem.one">libhandy community</a>, I brought Feeds back in line with the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/">GNOME HIG</a>. These are small changes, but surely needed ones to have a more consistent desktop experience.</p>
<p>Some of the features I had planned, detailed in some of my previous posts in this blog, still haven&rsquo;t made it, tho. To be fair, some of them require a decent amount of work, and I&rsquo;d be nice if someone wanted to help with implementing them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll try to cleanup the code more, using Glade templates where possible, splitting different classes in different files and uncluttering the logic a bit. It&rsquo;s probably one of the most boring things you could do, but if I want people to contribute, it has to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, stay tuned.</p>

      <title>Feeds 0.8: naming change and how to deal with Flatpak</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-8-naming-change-and-how-to-deal-with-flatpak/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 16:34:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-8-naming-change-and-how-to-deal-with-flatpak/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.gfeeds">Feeds version 0.8 is coming</a>. This release have been a little overdue, since I finally decided to change the name of the app from <code>gnome-feeds</code> to just <code>gfeeds</code>. This has to do with the use of the GNOME name, and besides even GNOME apps don&rsquo;t use the <em>GNOME</em> prefix in their names.</p>
<p>Someone criticized the name <code>gfeeds</code>, because it&rsquo;s kind of dumb to have GNOME/GTK app names to start with a <em>g</em>, similarly to how dumb it is to have KDE apps start with a <em>k</em>. But here&rsquo;s the catch: the <em>g</em> in <code>gfeeds</code> stands for <em>Gabriele</em>, <em>I pulled a sneaky on you</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the new name should have no problems whatsoever, and besides I learned how to transition to a new appid on Flathub.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as seamless as you would think, but it&rsquo;s easy enough. You&rsquo;ll have to re-submit your app as if it was a new one, and specify that it&rsquo;s just an appid change. There&rsquo;s some infrastructure in place to transition from one appid to another automagically, and it involves <a href="https://github.com/flathub/org.gabmus.gnome-feeds">a little extra json file</a> in the old repo. <a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/1141">Here you can see my PR for the new appid</a> and the whole discussion around it. Hope it helps.</p>
<p>As for new stuff, let&rsquo;s see what we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>More stability, broken feeds are automatically removed and error messages will be shown in an upcoming version (already in <code>master</code>).</li>
<li>OPML file association. Now you can just open your OPMLs from your file manager and have them imported in Feeds.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re offline, feeds won&rsquo;t be refreshed. Instead, an infobar will tell you that you&rsquo;re offline. Saved articles are still accessible.</li>
<li>CPU utilization is now lower, having removed some unnecessary busy waits from the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Again, still a lot of work to do, but little by little Feeds is coming together pretty well.</p>

      <title>GitLab CI/CD for Flatpak</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/gitlab-ci-cd-for-flatpak/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2019 12:24:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/gitlab-ci-cd-for-flatpak/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/wikis/DevOps-with-Flatpak">this document</a>, and a quick look at <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/tree/master">nautilus&rsquo;s git repo</a> I was able to automatically generate fresh flatpaks directly from GitLab by using the integrated CI/CD system.</p>
<p>My current setup isn&rsquo;t perfect but it manages to automate flatpak builds. This is incredibly useful, as when people open issues and I try to fix them, I can just tell them to install the lastest flatpak from the CI/CD and test the fixes.</p>
<p>Also, for power users and curious minds I imagine it could be compelling to be able to install the latest development snapshot without jumping through many hoops.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s get down to business, here&rsquo;s the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file to let the magic happen:</p>

      <title>Early adopter experience with the new Radeon RX 5700XT on Arch Linux</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/early-adopter-experience-with-the-new-radeon-rx-5700-xt-on-arch-linux/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>So I recently got myself a shiny new AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPU (that&rsquo;s a mouthful).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it does on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>First, I use Arch (btw) and that makes things a lot easier, at least for now. As of writing this, Navi support is still not in the mainline kernel, but it should come with Linux 5.3.</p>
<p>Because of the AUR and many other fun things, this isn&rsquo;t much of a problem in Arch.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised when you install the GPU in your PC and don&rsquo;t see Xorg or anything resembling a GUI popping up.</p>
<p>First, you need to add a new repo to your system. Put the following in <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code>, just above the <code>[core]</code> repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[mesa-git]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Server = https://pkgbuild.com/~lcarlier/$repo/$arch
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>SigLevel = Optional
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, let&rsquo;s install some packages:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo pacman -Sy amdvlk clang-git libclc-git libdrm-git llvm-git llvm-libs-git mesa-git opencl-mesa-git vulkan-mesa-layer-git vulkan-radeon-git xf86-video-amdgpu-git lib32-mesa-git lib32-mesa-git lib32-vulkan-radeon-git lib32-vulkan-mesa-layer-git
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will cover most of the stuff needed to make the GPU work correctly.</p>
<p>Now we need the new kernel modules. For this, you have two routes: install <code>amdgpu-dkms</code> from the AUR, <strong>or</strong> install <code>linux-git</code> from the AUR. I personally suggest you to go with <code>linux-git</code> as the dkms driver is not official as far as I know and doesn&rsquo;t cover all the stuff that&rsquo;s needed to make the GPU work 100% (like sensors support).</p>
<p>Whatever route you choose, there&rsquo;s still one more thing you need to install from the AUR: the <code>linux-firmware-agd5f-radeon-navi10</code> package. This is a package I made myself containing <a href="https://people.freedesktop.org/~agd5f/radeon_ucode/navi10/">the latest firmware for Navi 10 GPUs right from the driver developer</a>.</p>
<p>So, to summarize, here&rsquo;s a copy-paste command you can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>yay -S linux-git linux-firmware-agd5f-radeon-navi10
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Quick note, I tried installing <code>mesa-aco-git</code>, even just to give it a try, but unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to get Xorg (or Wayland for that matter) running with it. Maybe in the future, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-performance">Gaming performance</h2>
<p>First, all of the games I&rsquo;m gonna talk about were ran at 1440p. They were all tested in GNOME Wayland, and the ones showing problems were also tested in GNOME Xorg and XFCE.</p>
<p>So, performance is of course great, especially in native games. Here&rsquo;s a list of games I maxed out without any hiccup or visible problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rocket League</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dark Souls 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Road Redemption</strong></li>
<li><strong>CS:GO</strong></li>
<li><strong>DOOM 2016</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fallout 4</strong> (except for a mouse problem unrelated to the GPU)</li>
<li><strong>Tabletop Simulator</strong></li>
<li><strong>For The King</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Xonotic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Small note on The Witcher 3: it runs pretty much flawlessly, but I experienced some occasional frame rate drops, especially early on when I loaded the game. This usually goes away after 10 minutes or so of gameplay.</p>
<p>I had various problems with other games, and pretty weird ones, too. I think they&rsquo;re worth documenting.</p>
<h3 id="important-update">IMPORTANT UPDATE</h3>
<p>The games that are crossed out below don&rsquo;t actually have anything wrong with them. I am just dumb enough to have used the <strong>non git versions of the mesa 32 bit libraries</strong>. I updated the install command above, just to make sure nobody gets the same problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><del><strong>Distance</strong>: the game launches, but performance is terrible (2 fps in the menu at 1440p). Obviously there&rsquo;s something wrong, as the game is far from being <em>that</em> heavy.</del></li>
<li><del><strong>Screencheat</strong>: about 7 fps in game, 12 or so in the menu. Very similar to the problem with Distance.</del></li>
<li><del><strong>Hover: Revolt of Gamers</strong>: As above, performance is unexplainably terrible even in the main menu.</del></li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Tomb Raider</strong>: game seems to work fine, launches and the menu is perfectly responsive, but 5 seconds or so after I get in game, the whole game freezes into an unrecoverable state.</li>
<li><strong>Quake Champions</strong>: Similar to Rise of the Tomb Raider, menu works perfectly, almost instant freeze as soon as I get in game. But Quake Champions is far from being a technically well engineered game.</li>
<li><strong>Enter the Gungeon</strong>: Perfectly playable, but some of the graphics show some small amount of glitches.</li>
<li><strong>No Man&rsquo;s Sky</strong>: Games works almost perfectly, but the framerate drops heavily inside menus.</li>
</ul>
<p><del>An interesting fact: in the games I&rsquo;ve tested, where the framerate is unexplainably low, <code>sensors</code> shows the power draw of the GPU to be stuck at 30W (same as idle). Other games that give no problems like The Witcher 3 manage to raise the power draw between 150W and 300W. I later confirmed that (of course) the clock speeds (monitored via <code>sudo watch cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_pm_info</code>) are directly proportional to the power draw.</del></p>
<p><del>This probably shows something&rsquo;s wrong with the driver. It made me wonder if I could force a clock speed on the GPU manually to see if those games work fine. I didn&rsquo;t want to go that route since it would kinda count as an overclock and I&rsquo;m still not confident enough in my abilities or in the driver&rsquo;s.</del></p>
<p>What I did try to do was force the higher pstates (power states) on the GPU to see if that would work. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t. Following the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMDGPU#Overclocking">AMDGPU page on the Arch Wiki</a> I tried these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo -i <span style="color:#6272a4"># better be root for this</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">echo</span> <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;manual&#34;</span> &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">echo</span> <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;2&#34;</span> &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_mclk <span style="color:#6272a4"># set highest pstate 2 on the memory</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">echo</span> <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;5 6 7&#34;</span> &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_sclk <span style="color:#6272a4"># set higher pstates 5, 6 and 7 on the actual gpu</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This didn&rsquo;t work at all, and showed some rather interesting errors in dmesg, similar to this one: <code>Failed to send message 0x20, response 0xfffffffb param 0x5</code>. Of course searching for these messages gave me zero results.</p>
<p><strong>About OpenCL</strong>: Unsurprisingly Clover doesn&rsquo;t work, <del>but so doesn&rsquo;t the AMDGPU-PRO OpenCL implementation. Still need to investigate that further, I didn&rsquo;t get into much detail with OpenCL. Will do soon after I have these more serious problems sorted out.</del> OpenCL now works using the <code>opencl-amdgpu-pro-pal</code> package from AUR.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an entirely bad thing to be an early adopter. I mean, I am starting to understand how the driver works (kinda?) and digging into lower level stuff with the kernel and the GPU than I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>This said, there&rsquo;s still much I don&rsquo;t understand. I am willing to learn and help. If you have more experience with this stuff and want to add your voice to the conversation, don&rsquo;t hesitate to comment or contact me personally.</p>
<p>Will keep this blog updated with any news regarding making this GPU work.</p>

      <title>Feeds 0.7 and more features to come</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-7-and-more-features-to-come/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-7-and-more-features-to-come/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.gnome-feeds">Feeds version 0.7 should be out soon</a> with all the features detailed in <a href="/2019/08/20/Feeds-saving-articles-offline-and-marking-stuff-as-read/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>The code starts to feel a little more complex, and it would probably use another small refactoring, but that&rsquo;s not too important right now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s lay out a new roadmap, with the features I implemented, and some new ones I want to add:</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <del>Read and unread articles</del></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Keeping history of older articles locally (still not sure if I actually want this or not)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Adblocking</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <del>Saving articles</del></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Suggestions</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Integration with GNOME Online Accounts</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GabMus/gnome-feeds/issues/4">Integration with TTRSS</a></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Ability to open rss links and OPML files</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>Offline mode</em> with a banner indicating that the system is offline</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some work to do. Of course any help is welcome and appreciated.</p>

      <title>Feeds: saving articles offline and marking stuff as read</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-saving-articles-offline-and-marking-stuff-as-read/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 10:26:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-saving-articles-offline-and-marking-stuff-as-read/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p><a href="https://gabmus.gitlab.io/2019/08/12/feeds-0-6-and-roadmap-md/">In a previous post</a> I layed out a roadmap for my feed reader application <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.gnome-feeds"><strong>Feeds</strong></a>. Here&rsquo;s a little update on how things are going.</p>
<p>Alright, first I want to thank <a href="https://gitlab.com/etamuk">@Etamuk</a> again. He&rsquo;s being very active with the German translation, and any time I make a commit, soon after I already see he has opened a merge request with the updated translation. That&rsquo;s just impressive, and I&rsquo;m truly greatful for his awesome contributions!</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s get down to business with the new features.</p>
<h2 id="saving-articles">Saving articles</h2>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Feeds-saving-articles-offline-and-marking-stuff-as-read/save_article.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>Every article now has a right click or longpress popover that contains two buttons. The first one is a <em>Save</em> button. You can use it to save or <del>unsave</del> delete an article.</p>
<p>Once an article is saved, its content is downloaded and available offline. This allows easy consultation whenever you want and also provides an alternative to browser bookmarks or online &ldquo;read it later&rdquo; services.</p>
<h2 id="read-and-unread">Read and unread</h2>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Feeds-saving-articles-offline-and-marking-stuff-as-read/read_unread.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>A feature that I should have implemented from the beginning made its way into Feeds just now. Articles you read, are marked as read.</p>
<p>The marking was made in the laziest way possible: it just changes the article opacity to 50%. But in my opinion it works alright. Of course you can manually set an article as read or unread by using the dedicated button in the right click or longpress popover.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Maybe these sound like easy things to implement, but to be honest due to the structure of the application, and to the way things work to minimize disk usage and make the whole thing more dynamic and faster overall, to implement these features I had to touch up almost every little piece of the application.</p>
<p>It was worth it in the end, and I&rsquo;m happy of what I accomplished. Hope you like it too when it comes out. I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a 0.7 release. I don&rsquo;t have the feeling that Feeds is worth a 1.0 at the moment. Maybe I need someone to test it out and see how things are working.</p>

      <title>On privacy conscious comments and analytics</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/on_comments_and_analytics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 19:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/on_comments_and_analytics/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This blog is fairly new, and so I still have to set up everything. Comments are obviously a very important part of a blog, especially if you want any kind of feedback on the stuff you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The lazy solution is pretty obvious: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus#Criticism,_privacy,_and_security_concerns"><em>Disqus</em> the privacy nightmare</a>.</p>
<p>I like the wild idea of respecting my readers&rsquo; privacy, and so I started looking for alternative solutions.</p>
<p>The one solution I chose to adopt is an open source comment platform called <a href="https://commento.io/"><strong>Commento</strong></a>. It works just like Disqus, except since it doesn&rsquo;t make money from violating people&rsquo;s privacy, you can&rsquo;t really use it for free.</p>
<p>You can either choose to pay what you want for it (with a minimum of 3 USD) or host it yourself.</p>
<p>I already pay for a VPS for <a href="https://techpills.technology">Tech Pills&rsquo; website</a>, but it&rsquo;s not subject to heavy load, so a service more running on it wouldn&rsquo;t really hurt.</p>
<p>You can install Commento using <code>docker-compose</code>, which is very convenient. I made some changes to the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to better suit my needs, and put an nginx reverse proxy in front of it to add https into the mix.</p>
<p>After writing some CSS to adapt it to the blog&rsquo;s theme, the new comment box is ready to roll.</p>
<p>As a nice (unexpected) bonus, Commento also provides some basic analytics like total page views and number of comments. And that&rsquo;s all totally anonymous, it&rsquo;s just a faceless number that&rsquo;s not associated to any identity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about it, if you&rsquo;re looking for a privacy respecting, open source, powerful comment platform, that&rsquo;s also pretty easy to install and offers some bonus analytics on top, Commento is the way to go.</p>

      <title>Feeds 0.6 and future roadmap</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-6-and-roadmap-md/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 09:51:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-6-and-roadmap-md/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.gnome-feeds">Feeds version 0.6 is out</a> with two important changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>German translation thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/etamuk">@Etamuk</a></li>
<li>Concurrent feeds refresh</li>
</ul>
<p>About the translation, I know when a project starts becoming interesting, people want to contribute. And translations are in my experience one of the indication of people really getting passionate.</p>
<p>I am really flattered by this contribution and it really means a lot to see this project getting some love.</p>
<p>Moving on to the more technical stuff, concurrent refresh or parallel refresh.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly easy to implement, and that really shows how important having a modular and well-thought-out code structure is.</p>
<p>You see, the feed download and object creation (along with the creation of all the feed items) happens asynchronously already, but adding that feed, and all of its articles to the active lists doesn&rsquo;t. There is this wonderful function <code>GLib.idle_add(function, *args)</code> that makes this whole process so easy and elegant. This function does no more than telling the main thread to run <code>function(*args)</code> whenever it can, no rush (although to a human it&rsquo;s almost instantaneous). With this method the GUI thread doesn&rsquo;t get interrupted and the UI doesn&rsquo;t freeze, but the function is still ran synchronously to it, avoiding any problems of mutual exclusion to precious variables.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is the wonderful code that manages the parallel refresh. It&rsquo;s fairly straight forward, it keeps a pool of threads to run, and runs n of them at a time, where n is the maximum number of threads set by the user (defaults to a very mild 2).</p>
<p>Apart from making the refresh process faster by itself, it also reduces the impact of problems like one feed taking longer than the others to download or parse. It&rsquo;s not a likely occurrence, but if and when it happens, it doesn&rsquo;t injure the user experience too much. That&rsquo;s because the slow feed is being processed in its own thread, but the whole refresh operation doesn&rsquo;t have to wait on it.</p>
<p>Moving on, I wanted to lay out a roadmap of where I want Feeds to go in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read and unread articles</strong>: currently Feeds doesn&rsquo;t keep track of your actions, and if you did or didn&rsquo;t read an article. This would require some strcuture, like the serialization and deserialization of articles to a skinnier, more targeted data structure (probably something like tsv or json, but the latter is more likely)</li>
<li><strong>Keeping history of older articles locally</strong>: rss feeds typically don&rsquo;t contain the whole archive, mostly because the resulting file would be huge and unwieldy. But people may want to be able to re-read articles they saw some time prior. That&rsquo;s why there needs to be an option to store them up to the user&rsquo;s preference. Again, this needs serialization/deserialization as described in the bullet point above</li>
<li><strong>Adblocking</strong>: this speaks for itself. Modern websites are a mess, disabling JavaScript helps, but it&rsquo;s neither a soltion nor a silver bullet</li>
<li><strong>Saving articles</strong>: kinda like bookmarks, but not quite. Let&rsquo;s say you add this awesome blog to your feeds, and you read a super interesting article about how to make feeds refreshing concurrent with just a bunch of lines of code. You surely want to save that! I mean, it could be useful someday right? That&rsquo;s a likely usecase for me. Also, you&rsquo;d wanna keep it offline as well, just in case you need it when you&rsquo;re on a plane or something</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions</strong>: many online news readers give you suggestions on what to follow. It&rsquo;s an interesing feature and I&rsquo;d want to add that. People are so addicted and accustomed to social media websites that this is what they expect news consumption to be.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with GNOME Online Accounts</strong>: mostly to be able to sync with services like Nextcloud News. Would be a hell of a feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it folks. This is the list of what I&rsquo;d want to accomplish with Feeds. Not all of these features are easy, and some are prone to make the whole app slower, and that&rsquo;s one thing I 100% want to avoid.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="my-new-web-home">My new web home</h2>
<p>Hey people. I finally got around at creating a static blog.</p>
<p>After using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for a while, and initially deciding to try out <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, just to realize it&rsquo;s in a sad, outdated state right now, I settled on <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m crazy for JavaScript, quite the contrary. But I do realize it has its place sometimes. Using <code>npm</code> to install plugins is pretty clever, and besides at the end of the day I am the only one that has to use it.</p>
<p>It has a more complex structure compared to the aforementioned solutions, but if it gets the job done I can&rsquo;t complain too much.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>This is an interesting point in my life. In July I got my bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science, it was a pretty great achievement, and soon I&rsquo;ll be heading to Milan to get a master degree.</p>
<p>About my projects, things are going very well. I am focusing a lot on GTK/GNOME apps, probably because I&rsquo;m making things I want to use in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://gabmus.gitlab.io/HydraPaper">HydraPaper</a> got a pretty substantial update, introducing <a href="https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy">libhandy</a> into the mix to spice up its looks somehow, and mostly to make use of some comodity widgets it offers, namely the awesome <code>HdyPreferencesWindow</code>.</p>
<p>For the thesis of my bachelor&rsquo;s, I presented another interesting app called <a href="https://gitlab.com/GabMus/unifydmin">Unifydmin</a>. It&rsquo;s a control center and administration panel for servers. It&rsquo;s a very interesting project, but it&rsquo;s still quite rough around the edges. I have to find the motivation to pick it up again, but right now I&rsquo;m focused on another project.</p>
<p>And this project is <a href="https://gabmus.gitlab.io/gnome-feeds">Feeds</a>, a feed reader. It may sound dumb, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a single feed reader app for linux that I liked. Everything is either old, slow or electron based. After some time complaining about this (my girlfriend and friends can tell you about it), and basically using reddit and the podcasts I follow to get the latest news, I said F it, and made my own thing. It&rsquo;s going pretty well and the people that tried it seem to like it, and that makes me actually very proud of it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s about it for now. I hope I manage to get my S together and start blogging more frequently, because I quite enjoy being able to share dev stuff online.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see where that goes.</p>

Summary: In acest post voi descrie o sacina ce tine de calendarul Zimbra. Celendarul Zimbra permite multe operatii insa unele functii pot fi efectuate doar din consola. Deasemenea utilizarea unui script usureaza automatizarea procesului.<br>
###Sarcina pusa este:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crarea unui calendar comun pentru toti utilizatorii cu urmatoarele proprietati:
<ul>
<li>Calendarul trebuie sa fie inclus in toate conturile participantilor</li>
<li>Va fi completat de fiecare participant in conformitate cu programul zilei propriu.</li>
<li>Participantii pot vedea statutul celulilalt paricipant (Ocupar/Disponibil) in calendarul sau.</li>
<li>Participantii vor fi adaugati automat la crearea unui nou utilizator</li>
<li>Un cont specializat va integra toate calendarele pentru a crea reguli VOIP de readresare a apelurilor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crearea unui calendar comun cu zilelel de odihna si sarbatori.
<ul>
<li>Calendarul trebuie sa fie public.</li>
<li>Va fi administrat doar de o persoana</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-crarea-unui-calendar-comun-pentru-toti-utilizatorii">1. Crarea unui calendar comun pentru toti utilizatorii</h3>
<p>Se creaza un Operator de calendar, de ex. <code>robocall@domen.md</code>
Se creaza un un grup de distibutie cu toti paricipantii, de ex. <code>call.center@domen.md</code>
In acest grup se adauga toti participantii care vor partaja calendarele proprii</p>
<p>Se executa comanda <code>zmprov</code>  pentru a aadauga calendele din grupul <code>call.center@domen.md</code>:</p>

Summary: Export grants &amp; views of a delegated admin and create a new delegated admin with the same grants &amp; views</p>
<p>###Problem</p>
<p>Export grants &amp; views of a delegated admin and create a new delegated admin with the same grants &amp; views
###Solution</p>
<p>Note: This is only applicable for legacy admin module and does not apply for Zimbra NG module.</p>
<p>Here we have an existing delegated admin &ldquo;<a href="mailto:myadmin@DOMAIN.COM">myadmin@DOMAIN.COM</a>&rdquo; and we will create a new delegated admin &lsquo;&ldquo;<a href="mailto:newadmin@DOMAIN.COM">newadmin@DOMAIN.COM</a>&rdquo; with the same views and grants.</p>
<p>1). Check enabled views of existing delegated admin:-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov -l ga myadmin@DOMAIN.COM | egrep -i &#39;zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents|zimbraIsDelegatedAdminAccount:&#39; 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Output:-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents: accountListView
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents: downloadsView
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents: DLListView
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents: aliasListView
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents: resourceListView
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents: saveSearch
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zimbraIsDelegatedAdminAccount: TRUE 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>2). Check or export assigned rights of the delegated admin :-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov gg -g usr myadmin@DOMAIN.COM 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Output:-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>    target type  target id                            target name        grantee type grantee id                           grantee name       right
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ------------ ------------------------------------ ------------------ ------------ ------------------------------------ ------------------ --------------------
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    global                                            globalacltarget    usr          87609353-a8fb-4ed5-b750-6b538cd52f35 myadmin@DOMAIN.COM adminLoginCalendarResourceAs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    global                                            globalacltarget    usr          87609353-a8fb-4ed5-b750-6b538cd52f35 myadmin@DOMAIN.COM domainAdminZimletRights
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    domain       1ccb92be-56cc-4962-b964-b07af84dc118 DOMAIN.COM         usr          87609353-a8fb-4ed5-b750-6b538cd52f35 myadmin@DOMAIN.COM domainAdminConsoleRights
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>3). Now we have to fine tune above output for a new admin.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>global usr myadmin@DOMAIN.COM adminLoginCalendarResourceAs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>global usr myadmin@DOMAIN.COM domainAdminZimletRights
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>domain DOMAIN.COM usr myadmin@DOMAIN.COM domainAdminConsoleRights 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>4). Create a file &ldquo;/tmp/grants.txt&rdquo; with the exported grants and replace old admin name with new delegated admin.
Prepare exported grant file for new delegated admin (<a href="mailto:newadmin@DOMAIN.COM">newadmin@DOMAIN.COM</a>). The file must have grants in the following format:-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>grr global usr newadmin@DOMAIN.COM adminLoginCalendarResourceAs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>grr global usr newadmin@DOMAIN.COM domainAdminZimletRights 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>grr domain DOMAIN.COM usr newadmin@DOMAIN.COM domainAdminConsoleRights 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>5). Now we will create a new delegated admin with the same views as existing admin has: -</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov ca newadmin@DOMAIN.COM &lt;PASSWORD&gt; zimbraIsDelegatedAdminAccount TRUE zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents accountListView zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents downloadsView zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents DLListView zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents aliasListView zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents resourceListView zimbraAdminConsoleUIComponents saveSearch
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>6). Here we will assign grants from the prepared file in Step4:-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov &lt; /tmp/grants.txt 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>7). Now check grants of newly created delegated admin, the output of below command must be similar to the output of Step2:-</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov gg -g usr newadmin@DOMAIN.COM 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>###Extra Notes:</p>
<p>Some additional tips for those admins who loves to play with sed and awk:-</p>
<p>Here we are exporting and redirecting grants to a file, and preparing grants for new delegated admin.
NOTE: These steps are only for Domain and Global level grants. If there are other level grants assigned to delegated admin then use &ldquo;awk&rdquo; carefully to extract correct column.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov gg -g usr myadmin@DOMAIN.COM | grep ^global | awk &#39;{print $1,$3,$5,$6}&#39;  &gt;&gt; /tmp/grants.txt
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>zmprov gg -g usr myadmin@DOMAIN.COM | grep ^domain | awk &#39;{print $1,$3,$4,$6,$7}&#39;  &gt;&gt; /tmp/grants.txt

Summary: <img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1DwIusgQeMAAOb33Z_SsPp6lwF-gSezva" alt="Zimbra"> Script bash care notifica utilizatorii despre expirarea parolei</p>
<p>###INTRO
In instalatia default Zimbra notificarea catre utilizatori care informeaza utilizatorul despre expirarea parolei sale nu este transmis. Astfel utilizatorul este nevoit sa apeleze
la administratorul serviciului de posta electronica cu rugamintea de ai reseta parola (In cazul ca nu o cunoaste). Utilizatorii MS Outlook  primesc eroare la conectare.</p>
<p>In acest caz folosim un script Bash care in vom pune in cron, pentru a rula in fiecare zi.</p>

<ol>
<li>Spatiu estimativ pe Storage care va fi necesar:</li>
</ol>
<p>Dupa testarea solutiei pentru cateva cutii postale , a fost determinat ca 2.43 GB  dupa  efectuarea copiei de rezerva a fost obtinut 1.3GB ,
respectiv obtinem o rata de 53% . Solutia ZMBKPOSE utilizeaza compresia GZIP+TAR, in documentatia oficiala rata de compresie este in limita 21-26%.
Rezultatul din exemplu arata ca in copia de rezerva sunt prezente alte arhive care nu vor fi compresate.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Timpul de compresie</li>
</ol>
<p>Acest parametru depinde de mai multi factori: specificatia hardware, incarcarea sistemului (LA),
2.43	GB  au fost arhivate in 360s</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Mai jos este prezentat graficul de utilizare al CPU la arhivarea unui volum mai mare , cca 18GB</li>
</ol>
<p>Estimativ volumul total al mailbox-urilor de pe serverul meu este de cca. 195GB, care  va fi compresat in 103GB timp de 6 ore si 20 min.</p>
<p>Real volumul de 195 GB  a fost compresat in 158G si a durat 7 ore (de la ora 9 pina la 16, cu intreruperi)</p>

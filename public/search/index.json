different palettes and easily pick and name colors depending on their use.\ni had a look at some already available options, but nothing seemed to fit the bill, so (as it\u0026rsquo;s often the case) i decided to make my own.\ni want to make a quick tangent on how easy it has become for me to quickly hack together build a gtk app.\na big part of the reason is reusing existing code and tooling from my other projects, as well as learning the proper way to do things.\nanother big reason is the great ecosystem that\u0026rsquo;s been growing around gnome technologies recently, particularly after the release of gtk4.\nfirst of all, libadwaita is a huge help for building any kind of application. it ships a bunch of widgets and other useful tidbits such as pre-built style classes, implementing the rules defined in the gnome hig. this allows for quick building, clean code and great looks out of the box.\nbut libadwaita has already been praised enough by me and other developers, so that\u0026rsquo;s not really anything new.\nthe other incredibly useful tool that i\u0026rsquo;m using for my apps is blueprint by james westman. without going into too much detail, it\u0026rsquo;s a markup language for building gtk4 uis in a clean and simple way. you then use the blueprint compiler to compile it to regular xml without ever having to look at it yourself.\ngoing back to swatch, it\u0026rsquo;s really as simple as it gets: you can create as many palettes as you want, and you can add colors to each palette. you can give custom names to everything, and you can quickly copy the color in hexadecimal (or rgb()) format. i also decided to give swatch two view modes: list and grid, similar to what you\u0026rsquo;d see in a file manager.\nand with that said, this little tool does exactly what i need. hopefully you can find it useful as well.\nthe code is available on gnome gitlab as usual, and you can try it for yourself using the latest flatpak ci build.\nas for a proper release, i\u0026rsquo;m planning to tag one and submit it to flathub as soon as the gnome 42 runtime comes out, so stay tuned for that!\n","title":"Swatch: a color palette

it\u0026rsquo;s actually a rather easy task! that\u0026rsquo;s why i wanted to document this process, in hope that someone might find it useful one day.\nfirst off, you\u0026rsquo;ll need one or more blocklists, in json format. i used easylist, in particular here\u0026rsquo;s the link to the json block list. blocklists should be updated frequently, so it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to have some sort of mechanism to download and update them at runtime automatically.\nlet\u0026rsquo;s now jump to the code, which will be python in this case, but hopefully can be easily adapted to other languages.\ni\u0026rsquo;ll use some closures for convenience.\n# have a function that downloads text def download_text(url: str) -\u0026gt; str: # ... # create the filter store somewhere in your

# 0: retrieve the webkit2.usercontentmanager from the webview content_manager = webview.get_user_content_manager() def save_blocklist_cb(caller, res, *args): # 6: once saving is done we can retrieve the newly created # webkit2.usercontentfilter with save_finish and finally add th # filter to the webkit2.usercontentmanager try: filter = filter_store.save_finish(res)

containing a json), # we\u0026#39;ll need to convert it to glib.bytes, then save it in the store. # yes, we need to save it even if we want to refresh it every time, # this is just the way this works. # this is also async and when it\u0026#39;s done it will call continue on to # save_blocklist_cb filter_store.save( blocklist_id, glib.bytes.new(blocklist.encode()), none, save_blocklist_cb ) def download_blocklist(): # 4: download the blocklist and continue on to download_blocklist_cb try: res = download_text(blocklist_url) glib.idle_add(download_blocklist_cb, res) except:

thread(target=download_blocklist, daemon=true).start() # 1: try to load the blocklist from the store, this is async and will call # filter_load_cb when it\u0026#39;s done filter_store.load(blocklist_id, none, filter_load_cb, none) i decided to comment the example code above instead of writing disconnected descriptions here, hopefully it makes sense.\nthis said, if you want to look at the actual code that i\u0026rsquo;m using in feeds, you can find it here (this is a snapshot to today\u0026rsquo;s current latest commit, in the future you may want to look at newer code). it contains some logic to automatically refresh or even remove the blocklist.\nlet me know what you think in the comments, and feel free to point out any errors, or if something is

personal projects go, i spent at close contact with gtk4, libadwaita and the awesome people over at the various matrix chat rooms.\ni\u0026rsquo;ve spent this time porting what ip, hydrapaper and giara to gtk4+libadwaita.\ni\u0026rsquo;m really happy of the results, and i\u0026rsquo;m even happier with how this new stack is shaping up.\nthe porting process for the most part has been relatively painless across the board, with only minor changes (albeit, many of them) needed for the actual porting. along with the updated stack, i\u0026rsquo;ve been able to introduce new features and improvements, for the most part thanks to the new widgets available in libadwaita making my life a lot easier.\nwhat ip being the simpler of the bunch didn\u0026rsquo;t really change much from its original iteration, except for some code cleanups. but hey, the theme is different and it looks amazing!\nhydrapaper also stayed pretty much the same, with the exception of a new wallpaper folder selector (that you can see in the image above) in the form of a brand new widget, the mighty flap! it\u0026rsquo;s a sidebar that can open above other widgets, mostly a glorified overlay, but with extra bells and whistles. on a regular monitor you can open it with the usual button on the headerbar, the same that opened a popover before, but on a touchscreen you can swipe to open it! plus, compared to the previous popover implementation, the new flap is part of the main window, meaning it can scale to fill the entire vertical space of the window, making this selector/filter much easier to interact with thanks to the increased size.\ngiara being one of the more complex apps, received a lot more work and attention. first off, the post views have been re-implemented using listview, a brand new (still somewhat janky) widget in gtk4 that allows for better optimized lists, where rows get recycled instead of adding up, with performance quickly grinding to a halt. this change required a lot of work, since my usual terrible implementation of listbox is 100% incompatible with the way listview works. but with a lot of help and elbow grease, i managed to land it, making the whole experience of mindlessly scrolling through reddit a little less frustrating (hopefully). also, thanks to another awesome widget, adwcarousel, i was able to add support for image galleries. and they support touch gestures, too! along with these changes, i also added an internal fullscreen image viewer, very much inspired by the one in telegram-desktop.\nbut let\u0026rsquo;s jump to the actual reason why i\u0026rsquo;m writing this post, the new feeds.\nyou see, i wanted to start porting feeds to gtk4 sooner than it ended up happening. unfortunately, i wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to up until recently. the reason being webkit. webkit support for gtk4 has been broken for a while, and just recently (not all that recently, tho) it got to a point where it was usable enough for me to start the port. at the time of writing this, you still need to enable gtk4 support in webkit by using custom build flags, making development possible by building webkit myself (which, by the way, takes a lot of time), but at the same time making distribution unfeasible. flatpak being the main way i distribute my apps, it could work in theory, but having a 1gb+ bundle for a simple news reader isn\u0026rsquo;t really a great user experience, so for now i\u0026rsquo;m holding off this release, waiting for it to become available in the gnome runtime.\nbut let\u0026rsquo;s move on to what\u0026rsquo;s actually new in feeds.\nfirst of all, from a user facing perspective, the whole look of the app is quite different. apart from the new adwaita theme in libadwaita, the article list uses the new navigation-sidebar style class, with cool rounded corners for the rows and no separators between them, but still providing enough visual separation. label sizes in the rows have also been tweaked slightly.\noh, and of course, i added article pictures! the code is based on the custom picture widget i made for giara, and let me tell you: they make any article that more interesting!\nas for visual changes, another big one is the new filter view, again based on the flap widget.\nit\u0026rsquo;s a similar story to hydrapaper, the old popover implementation was hard to use and unintuitive. a sidebar is a much more common pattern, plus the added vertical size makes it easier to find the feed you wanna look at.\nas for the articles list, you may think listview would be perfect here as well, and that\u0026rsquo;s what i thought as well. unfortunately due to some technical issues with how listview row selection and activation work at this current time, while it does work, it\u0026rsquo;s not really all that convenient. i added the listview to feeds, and you can enable it in the preferences, in the advanced section, but i kept the listbox around as a default, and i also changed its api so that it\u0026rsquo;s the same as the listview implementation. you can switch between one or the other and try them out for yourself, hopefully at some point i can get rid of the listbox and have the listview be the default.\nwith all the nice changes and cool things this port brought with it, i decided to tackle one of the most annoying issues i\u0026rsquo;ve had with feeds: the actual feed parsing.\nup until recently i\u0026rsquo;ve been using the very popular feedparser python library, but i\u0026rsquo;ve always been dissatisfied with both its performance and its weird quirks. i came to the conclusion that it\u0026rsquo;s not the kind of library i was looking for.\ni tried searching for alternatives, and i broadened my search to any language, but unfortunately i couldn\u0026rsquo;t find something i really liked.\nso i decided to write my own! and for the best performance i wrote it in\u0026hellip; c++! maybe some of you were expecting rust? maybe one day, but i don\u0026rsquo;t really know rust right now 😕\nthis new library is called sydndication domination or syndom for short (it\u0026rsquo;s a bit cheesy, i know). syndom is tailor made for feeds, but of course it can be used for any application.\nit\u0026rsquo;s based around an awesome xml parser for c++ called pugixml, if you ever need to parse xml i suggest you take a look at it. syndom is able to parse an rss or atom file and extract all the useful information a news reader would need, and most importantly, it does the heavy lifting of trying all the different places a certain information can be found in. it can also parse opml files for importing feeds, as well as html files for extracting other useful information from, say a blog post, like the featured image, the feed url, the title or the description.\nthe whole thing comes together inside feeds with python bindings, created using another library called pybind11.\nhonestly this has probably been the biggest change to ever come to feeds. the performance difference is enormous, it\u0026rsquo;s like night and day, and i couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier about it.\nso that\u0026rsquo;s all i wanted you to know, hopefully i can release feeds sooner rather than later as i really, really want people to use this new version rather than the crusty old one.\nif you want to try it for yourself you can download a recent snapshot i made manually from this link. please do let me know what you think in the comments or in the matrix room if you prefer. and feel free to report any bugs you encounter along the way!\n","title":"Gtk4,

ha! trick question! if you know me (or can read the title) you know we\u0026rsquo;ll be using python. besides i\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you can use whatever language you prefer, but today that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re gonna use.\nbefore we begin, it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to choose a unique id for our daemon using the reverse domain name notation. for the hydrapaper daemon i chose org.gabmus.hydrapaper.daemon. it\u0026rsquo;s important that your name is unique, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to name it something like ext.yourpersonalhandle.yourapplicationname.daemon. another good idea is if you have a registered domain like i do for gabmus.org, to just use that, followed by the name of your app and some other indication that this service will be a daemon. you can read more about valid names here.\nonce you have decided this id, just put it in a constant, along with the same but separated by slashes as if it was a path, like this:\nuid = \u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon\u0026#39; uid_as_path = \u0026#39;/org/gabmus/myapp/daemon\u0026#39; # notice the leading slash let\u0026rsquo;s now start with the basics: we need a class extending dbus.service.object. this will be our d-bus object, and some of the methods inside of it will be exposed as d-bus methods.\nimport dbus import dbus.service # yes, you need to import this as well uid = \u0026#39;org.gabmus.hydrapaper.daemon\u0026#39; uid_as_path = \u0026#39;/org/gabmus/hydrapaper/daemon\u0026#39; class myappdaemon(dbus.service.object): def __init__(self, bus_name): super().__init__( bus_name, uid_as_path ) now before moving on, i decided to include the final part here: bootstrapping our main loop and all of the things we need to get this bad boy running, so that you can actually try things out and see what\u0026rsquo;s going on instead of just blindly copy-pasting.\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll need these additional imports:\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import dbusgmainloop from gi.repository import glib let\u0026rsquo;s move to the bottom of the file and create a main function, just to do things cleanly:\ndef main(): dbusgmainloop(set_as_default=true) try: bus_name = dbus.service.busname( uid, bus=dbus.sessionbus(), do_not_queue=true ) except dbus.exceptions.nameexistsexception: print(f\u0026#39;service with id {uid} is already running\u0026#39;) exit(1) loop = glib.mainloop() daemon = myappdaemon(bus_name) try: loop.run() except keyboardinterrupt: print(\u0026#39;keyboardinterrupt received\u0026#39;) except exception as e: print(\u0026#39;unhandled exception: `{}`\u0026#39;.format(str(e))) finally: loop.quit() if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() alright, let\u0026rsquo;s resume from where we left.\nwe have a d-bus object, and the thing can run doing nothing now, awesome.\nlet\u0026rsquo;s give this object a method we can invoke from outside.\nto do this we\u0026rsquo;ll create a method in our class and decorate it with @dbus.service.method. this decorator takes some parameters:\ndbus_interface: the interface we want this method to be attached to (interfaces are another nesting level for d-bus, honestly i think they\u0026rsquo;re overkill for this kind of use, so we\u0026rsquo;re just going to use our previously declared uid as the interface, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna work). in_signature: what kind of parameters our method requires out_signature: what kind of output our method returns for the signatures, you can read more about data types you can use in this documentation page.\nlet\u0026rsquo;s create a simple hello method that takes a string and returns another string.\nclass myappdaemon(dbus.service.object): # ... @dbus.service.method( dbus_interface=uid, in_signature=\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;, out_signature=\u0026#39;s\u0026#39; ) def hello(self, your_name: str) -\u0026gt; str: return f\u0026#39;hi there, {your_name}!\u0026#39; that\u0026rsquo;s it! easy, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nnow if like me you want to have some action to run every x seconds or something, you can just use the standard threads and sleep model of python, not much else you need as far as d-bus goes.\nnow, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we need to do to package this new daemon in a flatpak and have it being recognized by the system as proper and activatable d-bus service.\nplumbing first off, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using meson, so i assume you already are using it for your base application.\nassuming we have our daemon inside a sub-folder called myapp_daemon. for packages reasons i suggest you call the actual daemon python file something like myappd.in.py. notice the trailing d, it means daemon. another thing: make sure to give this file executable permissions! (chmod +x myapp_daemon/myappd.in.py)\nat the beginning of myappd.in.py we\u0026rsquo;re going to insert our shebang like this:\n#!@python@ in our main meson.build file, the one in the root of the project, let\u0026rsquo;s put the following somewhere you feel is appropriate (skip anything that is already there of course):\nprefix = get_option(\u0026#39;prefix\u0026#39;) datadir = get_option(\u0026#39;datadir\u0026#39;) libexecdir = join_paths(prefix, get_option(\u0026#39;libexecdir\u0026#39;)) etcdir = get_option(\u0026#39;sysconfdir\u0026#39;) dbus_service_dir = dependency( \u0026#39;dbus-1\u0026#39; ).get_pkgconfig_variable( \u0026#39;session_bus_services_dir\u0026#39;, define_variable: [\u0026#39;datadir\u0026#39;, join_paths(prefix, datadir)] ) python = import(\u0026#39;python\u0026#39;) py_installation = python.find_installation(\u0026#39;python3\u0026#39;) if not py_installation.found() error(\u0026#39;no valid python3 binary found\u0026#39;) endif subdir(\u0026#39;myapp_daemon\u0026#39;) subdir(\u0026#39;data\u0026#39;) now, let\u0026rsquo;s create myapp_daemon/meson.build, and put this inside:\ndaemon_conf = configuration_data() daemon_conf.set(\u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, py_installation.path()) configure_file( input: meson.project_name() + \u0026#39;d.in.py\u0026#39;, output: meson.project_name() + \u0026#39;d\u0026#39;, install: true, install_dir: libexecdir, configuration: daemon_conf ) that\u0026rsquo;s it for the daemon itself, but we still need some other files to let flatpak (or your host operating system for that matter if you install this with a regular package manager) recognize this as an activatable service.\nnote: an activatable service means a service that will be started automagically as soon as an application tries to connect to it.\nfor this, i like to work inside of a new folder called data inside the project root.\ninside data let\u0026rsquo;s create:\norg.gabmus.myapp.daemon.desktop.in containing:\n[desktop entry] name=org.gabmus.myapp.daemon comment=daemon for myapp icon=org.gabmus.myapp.daemon exec=@libexecdir@/myappd x-gnome-autostart-delay=10 startupnotify=false nodisplay=true type=application org.gabmus.myapp.daemon.service.in containing:\n[d-bus service] name=org.gabmus.myapp.daemon exec=@libexecdir@/myappd meson.build (if it exists already, just add to it) containing:\ndata_conf = configuration_data() data_conf.set(\u0026#39;libexecdir\u0026#39;, libexecdir) configure_file( input: \u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon.desktop.in\u0026#39;, output: \u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon.desktop\u0026#39;, configuration: data_conf, install: true, install_dir: join_paths(etcdir, \u0026#39;xdg\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;autostart\u0026#39;) ) configure_file( input: \u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon.service.in\u0026#39;, output: \u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon.service\u0026#39;, configuration: data_conf, install: true, install_dir: dbus_service_dir ) finally, we need to tell flatpak that the org.gabmus.myapp.daemon name is owned by our application. to do this let\u0026rsquo;s add the following to our flatpak manifest, inside the finish-args array:\n\u0026#34;--own-name=org.gabmus.myapp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--own-name=org.gabmus.myapp.daemon\u0026#34; great! now in theory everything should be in place, of course let me know if anything is broken or doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, the comment section is there to be used!\nfor the final section of this small tutorial, let\u0026rsquo;s see how to call the method we created.\nsummon the daemon for this last section, i\u0026rsquo;ll just leave you with some very brief example code in python, hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to follow:\nimport dbus def summon_hello(name): try: bus = dbus.sessionbus() obj = bus.get_object( \u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;/org/gabmus/myapp/daemon\u0026#39; ) interface = dbus.interface( obj, dbus_interface=\u0026#39;org.gabmus.myapp.daemon\u0026#39; ) return interface.hello(name) except dbus.exceptions.dbusexception: print(\u0026#39;failed to communicate with `org.gabmus.myapp.daemon`!\u0026#39;) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39; hope you can find this tutorial useful. mind you, i\u0026rsquo;m not an expert in this matter, i just did this and failed to find a single tutorial summarizing all of what i needed, so i decided to make one myself.\nif you find that anything doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as expected (maybe i missed a step or two?) please let me know in the comments, or contact me directly by using one of the contacts you can find in the about page.\n","title":"Making a D-Bus Daemon with Python and Flatpak"},{"date":"2020-10-30","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_linux/","summary":"I am a quite avid reddit user.

mouthful).\nlet\u0026rsquo;s see how it does on linux.\ninstallation first, i use arch (btw) and that makes things a lot easier, at least for now. as of writing this, navi support is still not in the mainline kernel, but it should come with linux 5.3.\nbecause of the aur and many other fun things, this isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a problem in arch.\ndon\u0026rsquo;t be surprised when you install the gpu in your pc and don\u0026rsquo;t see xorg or anything resembling a gui popping up.\nfirst, you need to add a new repo to your system. put the following in /etc/pacman.conf, just above the [core] repository:\n[mesa-git] server = https://pkgbuild.com/~lcarlier/$repo/$arch siglevel = optional now, let\u0026rsquo;s install some packages:\nsudo pacman -sy amdvlk clang-git libclc-git libdrm-git llvm-git llvm-libs-git mesa-git opencl-mesa-git vulkan-mesa-layer-git vulkan-radeon-git xf86-video-amdgpu-git lib32-mesa-git lib32-mesa-git lib32-vulkan-radeon-git lib32-vulkan-mesa-layer-git this will cover most of the stuff needed to make the gpu work correctly.\nnow we need the new kernel modules. for this, you have two routes: install amdgpu-dkms from the aur, or install linux-git from the aur. i personally suggest you to go with linux-git as the dkms driver is not official as far as i know and doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover all the stuff that\u0026rsquo;s needed to make the gpu work 100% (like sensors support).\nwhatever route you choose, there\u0026rsquo;s still one more thing you need to install from the aur: the linux-firmware-agd5f-radeon-navi10 package. this is a package i made myself containing the latest firmware for navi 10 gpus right from the driver developer.\nso, to summarize, here\u0026rsquo;s a copy-paste command you can run:\nyay -s linux-git linux-firmware-agd5f-radeon-navi10 quick note, i tried installing mesa-aco-git, even just to give it a try, but unfortunately i wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to get xorg (or wayland for that matter) running with it. maybe in the future, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\ngaming performance first, all of the games i\u0026rsquo;m gonna talk about were ran at 1440p. they were all tested in gnome wayland, and the ones showing problems were also tested in gnome xorg and xfce.\nso, performance is of course great, especially in native games. here\u0026rsquo;s a list of games i maxed out without any hiccup or visible problem:\nrocket league dark souls 3 road redemption cs:go doom 2016 the witcher 3 fallout 4 (except for a mouse problem unrelated to the gpu) tabletop simulator for the king keep talking and nobody explodes xonotic small note on the witcher 3: it runs pretty much flawlessly, but i experienced some occasional frame rate drops, especially early on when i loaded the game. this usually goes away after 10 minutes or so of gameplay.\ni had various problems with other games, and pretty weird ones, too. i think they\u0026rsquo;re worth documenting.\nimportant update the games that are crossed out below don\u0026rsquo;t actually have anything wrong with them. i am just dumb enough to have used the non git versions of the mesa 32 bit libraries. i updated the install command above, just to make sure nobody gets the same problems.\ndistance: the game launches, but performance is terrible (2 fps in the menu at 1440p). obviously there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong, as the game is far from being that heavy. screencheat: about 7 fps in game, 12 or so in the menu. very similar to the problem with distance. hover: revolt of gamers: as above, performance is unexplainably terrible even in the main menu. rise of the tomb raider: game seems to work fine, launches and the menu is perfectly responsive, but 5 seconds or so after i get in game, the whole game freezes into an unrecoverable state. quake champions: similar to rise of the tomb raider, menu works perfectly, almost instant freeze as soon as i get in game. but quake champions is far from being a technically well engineered game. enter the gungeon: perfectly playable, but some of the graphics show some small amount of glitches. no man\u0026rsquo;s sky: games works almost perfectly, but the framerate drops heavily inside menus. an interesting fact: in the games i\u0026rsquo;ve tested, where the framerate is unexplainably low, sensors shows the power draw of the gpu to be stuck at 30w (same as idle). other games that give no problems like the witcher 3 manage to raise the power draw between 150w and 300w. i later confirmed that (of course) the clock speeds (monitored via sudo watch cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_pm_info) are directly proportional to the power draw.\nthis probably shows something\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the driver. it made me wonder if i could force a clock speed on the gpu manually to see if those games work fine. i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go that route since it would kinda count as an overclock and i\u0026rsquo;m still not confident enough in my abilities or in the driver\u0026rsquo;s.\nwhat i did try to do was force the higher pstates (power states) on the gpu to see if that would work. of course, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. following the amdgpu page on the arch wiki i tried these commands:\nsudo -i # better be root for this echo \u0026#34;manual\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level echo \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_mclk # set highest pstate 2 on the memory echo \u0026#34;5 6 7\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_sclk # set higher pstates 5, 6 and 7 on the actual gpu this didn\u0026rsquo;t work at all, and showed some rather interesting errors in dmesg, similar to this one: failed to send message 0x20, response 0xfffffffb param 0x5. of course searching for these messages gave me zero results.\nabout opencl: unsurprisingly clover doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, but so doesn\u0026rsquo;t the amdgpu-pro opencl implementation. still need to investigate that further, i didn\u0026rsquo;t get into much detail with opencl. will do soon after i have these more serious problems sorted out. opencl now works using the opencl-amdgpu-pro-pal package from aur.\nconclusions it\u0026rsquo;s not an entirely bad thing to be an early adopter. i mean, i am starting to understand how the driver works (kinda?) and digging into lower level stuff with the kernel and the gpu than i\u0026rsquo;ve ever had.\nthis said, there\u0026rsquo;s still much i don\u0026rsquo;t understand. i am willing to learn and help. if you have more experience with this stuff and want to add your voice to the conversation, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to comment or contact me personally.\nwill keep this blog updated with any news regarding making this gpu work.\n","title":"Early adopter experience with the new Radeon RX 5700XT on Arch

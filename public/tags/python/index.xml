      <description>One of the most requested features (and for a good reason) in Feeds has always been ad blocking.
I never came around to implement it, mostly because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a guide or any similar resource, except for GNOME Web&amp;rsquo;s source code, and that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly easy to navigate.</description>

      <description>I learned most of this stuff from this awesome series of articles by Larry Price. Give it a read, it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.
Why D-Bus daemons are quite useful tools. What would you need them for?</description>

      <description>The back and forward buttons on your mouse are incredibly useful, at least for me. I use them all the time!
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a proper way to map it on my app until I asked on the GTK Matrix chatroom, there baedert sent me a couple of links to how he did it in his app corebird.</description>

      <description>One of the most common things you might wanna do with images, that is making them automatically resize to adapt to the available space they have, is not possible with Gtk.</description>

      <title>Python unittest &#43; Meson</title>

      <description>Alright, I started writing some unit tests for Feeds and I wanted to integrate them into meson, so that I can just run meson test or ninja test during build and have them run automagically.</description>

      <title>Feeds moved to World and design overhaul</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-moved-to-world-and-design-overhaul/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-moved-to-world-and-design-overhaul/</guid>
      <description>It finally happened, Feeds is now part of the World group! Here&amp;rsquo;s the new repository! But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep up with the existing GitLab mirror.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t change too much in terms of development, but it surely makes the app more discoverable.</description>

      <title>Feeds 0.8: naming change and how to deal with Flatpak</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-8-naming-change-and-how-to-deal-with-flatpak/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-8-naming-change-and-how-to-deal-with-flatpak/</guid>
      <description>Feeds version 0.8 is coming. This release have been a little overdue, since I finally decided to change the name of the app from gnome-feeds to just gfeeds. This has to do with the use of the GNOME name, and besides even GNOME apps don&amp;rsquo;t use the GNOME prefix in their names.</description>

      <title>Feeds 0.7 and more features to come</title>

      <guid>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/feeds-0-7-and-more-features-to-come/</guid>
      <description>Feeds version 0.7 should be out soon with all the features detailed in this post.
The code starts to feel a little more complex, and it would probably use another small refactoring, but that&amp;rsquo;s not too important right now.</description>

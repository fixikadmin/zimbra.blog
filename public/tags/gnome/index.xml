      <description>I learned most of this stuff from this awesome series of articles by Larry Price. Give it a read, it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.
Why D-Bus daemons are quite useful tools. What would you need them for?</description>

      <description>I am a quite avid reddit user. Like it or not, reddit is a very central place where communities for stuff that I care about tend to aggregate.
For the longest time, I have felt the need for a reddit app on my Linux desktop, and I waited and kept waiting for one that would finally allow me to break free of using the web version.</description>

      <title>Feeds moved to World and design overhaul</title>

      <description>It finally happened, Feeds is now part of the World group! Here&amp;rsquo;s the new repository! But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep up with the existing GitLab mirror.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t change too much in terms of development, but it surely makes the app more discoverable.</description>

      <title>Feeds 0.8: naming change and how to deal with Flatpak</title>

      <description>Feeds version 0.8 is coming. This release have been a little overdue, since I finally decided to change the name of the app from gnome-feeds to just gfeeds. This has to do with the use of the GNOME name, and besides even GNOME apps don&amp;rsquo;t use the GNOME prefix in their names.</description>

      <title>GitLab CI/CD for Flatpak</title>
      <link>http://blog.zimbra.md/posts/gitlab-ci-cd-for-flatpak/</link>

      <description>Thanks to this document, and a quick look at nautilus&amp;rsquo;s git repo I was able to automatically generate fresh flatpaks directly from GitLab by using the integrated CI/CD system.
My current setup isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect but it manages to automate flatpak builds.</description>

      <description>Feeds version 0.7 should be out soon with all the features detailed in this post.
The code starts to feel a little more complex, and it would probably use another small refactoring, but that&amp;rsquo;s not too important right now.</description>
